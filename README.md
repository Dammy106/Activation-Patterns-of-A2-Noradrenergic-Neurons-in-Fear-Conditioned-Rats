# Activation-Patterns-of-A2-Noradrenergic-Neurons-in-Fear-Conditioned-Rats
This repository explores the activation patterns of A2 noradrenergic neurons in fear-conditioned rats, using statistical analyses like t-tests and linear regression in R. It focuses on the differences in dopamine Î²-hydroxylase (DbH) neuron activation between various environmental conditions.
